# review challenge

oldUser = 'Alex'  # variable, 1 equals sign
newUser = input("What is your name? --> ")  # returns a string
if oldUser == newUser:  # testing equality, 2 equal signs
    print()  # what do you think this does
    print("Welcome back Alex!")
else:
    print()
    print("Welcome " + newUser + " it is nice to meet you!")


# Review Challenge: Run the code and predict what will be printed
# Questions to ask yourself...
#     Do you know what the == sign means?
#     Why do you only use 1 = sign in line 3 and 4?
#     Why are we adding the strings together on line 8?
#     What does the empty print statement do in line 6 or 9?
#     Can both of those statements ever print at the same time?
