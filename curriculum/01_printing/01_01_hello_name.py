# Challenge 1.1 - Figure out how to run the code.

# Challenge 1.2 - Change it to say "Bye (name)!" at the end.

# Challenge 1.3 - Change it to say
#    "(name) is a nice name."
#    and then
#    "Nice to meet you, (name)!"
# Hint: Add another print() function call.

# Challenge 1.4 - Change it to ALSO ask for an interesting fact, with
#    "Tell me an interesting fact!"
