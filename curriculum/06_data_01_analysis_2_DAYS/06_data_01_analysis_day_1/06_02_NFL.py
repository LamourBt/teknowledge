# Challenge 2.0 - If this is a new database or if you have forgotten what it
# contains, follow the steps in 06_01_IMDB.py to familiarize yourself with the
# database. This includes printing the names of everything in the database, all
# its attributes, and actually looking at the original file.
#
# NOTE: you will notice that this database is a little different, because the type
# of each team's Passing Statistics is a dictionary. To access the data within
# Passing Statistics, you would use the same [] notation you use to access data
# in the overall database. For example, to access Touchdown Percent, I would do this:
#
# NFLData["Pittsburgh Steelers"]["Passing Statistics"]["Touchdown Percent"]



# Challenge 2.1 - As a warmup, write code that prints out the name of the team
# in the database that had the most points.



# Challenge 2.2 - Now it's your turn to decide what you want to know about this
# database! Determine a question you want to answer, or a computer program you
# want to make, and use examples from the past 2 days to plan out how to write
# the code for it. Ask your mentors if you need help determining how to write
# code to answer your question!
#
# Sample Questions:
# 1) What is the average pass yards across all teams in this database?
#
# 2) Which president was the oldest when he left office?
#
# 3) Which team had the most yards in the 2016-2017 season?
#
# 4) Write a program that goes through every president in the database, asks the
#    uses a trivia question about the president using input(), and then tells
#    them if they are right or wrong. At the end, it should print out the total
#    number of correct and wrong answers the user got.
#
# 5) If you were to use this data to predict which team will do the best in
#    the 2017-2018 season, how would you do that? What factors would you take
#    into account, and how would you represent your answer? Brainstorm with your
#    mentor, and then code it up!
#
# 8) Make your own question! Discuss it with your mentor if you want to brainstorm
#    how to write code for your question/program!
