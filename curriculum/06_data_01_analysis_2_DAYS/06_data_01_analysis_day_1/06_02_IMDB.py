# Challenge 2.0 - If this is a new database or if you have forgotten what it
# contains, follow the steps in 06_01_IMDB.py to familiarize yourself with the
# database. This includes printing the names of everything in the database, all
# its attributes, and actually looking at the original file.



# Challenge 2.1 - As a warmup, write code that prints out the name of the most
# recent movie in this database.



# Challenge 2.2 - Now it's your turn to decide what you want to know about this
# database! Determine a question you want to answer, or a computer program you
# want to make, and use examples from the past 2 days to plan out how to write
# the code for it. Ask your mentors if you need help determining how to write
# code to answer your question!
#
# Sample Questions:
# 1) What is the average rating of movies in this database?
#
# 2) In what year were most movies in this database created?
#
# 3) Which genre is the most common in this database?
#
# 4) Who has starred in the most movies in this database?
#
# NOTE: if you decide to do 3 or 4, instead of keeping track of one variable
# throughout the loop, you will have to keep track of one variable per
# star/genre. Dictionaries are very effective for this. Discuss how to use
# dictionaries for this problem with your mentor before starting.
#
# 5) Write a program that goes through every movie in the database, asks the
#    user if they have seen that movie, and at the end prints out how many of the
#    movies in thise database the user has seen.
# 
# 6) Make your own question! Discuss it with your mentor if you want to brainstorm
#    how to write code for your question!
