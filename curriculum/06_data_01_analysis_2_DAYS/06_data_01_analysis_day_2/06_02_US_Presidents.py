# Challenge 2.0 - If this is a new database or if you have forgotten what it
# contains, follow the steps in 06_01_IMDB.py to familiarize yourself with the
# database. This includes printing the names of everything in the database, all
# its attributes, and actually looking at the original file.



# Challenge 2.1 - As a warmup, write code that prints out the name of the President
# with the highest average approval rating.
#
# Hint: Some presidents may have None as their approval rapting, if there is no
# data for that yet. Since you cannot compare None to a number (for example,
# None > 1.0 will give an error) you have to first make sure that the value is not
# None before comparing it with another number. Ask your mentor if you have questions.



# Challenge 2.2 - Now it's your turn to decide what you want to know about this
# database! Determine a question you want to answer, or a computer program you
# want to make, and use examples from the past 2 days to plan out how to write
# the code for it. Ask your mentors if you need help determining how to write
# code to answer your question!
#
# Sample Questions:
# 1) Which president had the lowest unemployment rate in the last month of his
#    presidency?
#
# 2) Which quarterback has the highest completion percentage?
#
# 3) How many presidents in the database had 8-year terms?
#
# 4) How many presidents in the database had only one vice president?
#    Hint: remember len()?
#
# 5) What is the difference between the number of Democrats and Republicans
#    in the white house, based on this database?
#
# 6) Which college/university graduated the most presidents in this database?
#
# NOTE: if you decide to do 6, instead of keeping track of one variable
# throughout the loop, you will have to keep track of one variable per
# college. Dictionaries are very effective for this. Discuss how to use
# dictionaries for this problem with your mentor before starting.
#
# 7) Write a program that goes through every president in the database, asks the
#    uses a trivia question about the president using input(), and then tells
#    them if they are right or wrong. At the end, it should print out the total
#    number of correct and wrong answers the user got.
#
# 8) Make your own question! Discuss it with your mentor if you want to brainstorm
#    how to write code for your question!
