# Who/what is Teknowledge?
Teknowledge's mission is to create a introductory CS curriculum for text-based programming. (This is not a Google product, but worked on as part of a Googler's 20% time.)

The current curriculum is being developed targeting 7th-8th grade students in Pittsburgh, though we aim to share it as widely as it finds use.

# Using Teknowledge's Curriculum

This curriculum is meant to be used in seven lessons, running 60-90 minutes long, that each roughly follow this format:
* a "paper programming"/interactive activity, such as "People Pathing" for the first lesson
* (rest of time) students work through the instructions on the worksheet (we recommend printing out physical copies for each student)
	* encourage them to ask questions of instructors/mentors as they need help (ideally you have small groups of 2-4 students with one mentor each)
	* encourage them to collaborate together with each other to ask questions and help each other, but also to NEVER mindlessly copy someone else's code that they don't understand (that is where your learning will stop, wastes the time spent on finishing the file, and majorly hurts your future learning and future abilities)

Many of the lessons may spill over into multiple days/sessions, depending on the background and pace of the students' learning.

# Dependencies

This curriculum heavily uses [trinket.io](http://trinket.io), to them we are grateful. Note that this curriculum working depends on trinket.io allowing python3 to be freely run on their site.  There is a hack that we use to turn python2 files into python3 files, but if you use the tinyurl.com links throughout, this line should be included already at the top of the python files:

```python
#!/bin/python3
```

Note that this curriculum is incomplete as presented here; the third part of our curriculum used a proprietary python environment for more advanced graphics programming, thus we could not open-source that portion.

# Curriculum Overview: Lesson-by-Lesson

* calling functions

**1.1: Loopy the Turtle**
* loops
* variables (kind of)

**2.0: Mad Libs**

* variables
* print()
* input()

**2.1: Trivia Night**
* conditionals (if, elif, else)
* loops
* print(), input()

**2.2: Function Fortune Teller**
* writing functions
* using the random library

**2.3 & 2.4: Make Your Own Adventure** (2 lessons)
* functions calling other functions
* bringing together many of the concepts learned to make a final project/game!
